# MaintenanceKeep 

MaintenanceKeep is a program that will help you keep track of tasks that need to be done repeatedly. It includes a dashboard, and a series of URLs that you can access to notify the system that tasks have been completed. It's recommended to create QR codes for these URLs, so that you can easily check off tasks from everywhere. 

Some examples of things that you can keep track of

- When to change the oil in your car
- When your HVAC filter needs to be replaced
- When you need to renew your license

## Why not keep this on a "to do" list?

Some tasks always need doing - it's just a matter of time before they come due again. It's nice to have a self-hosted system to manage these tasks for you, so you know the state of your maintenance work at a glance
